# Lynx Lifts

### 1. Project Description

**Lynx Lifts** is a mobile application developed to address transportation challenges faced by students at **Rhodes College**. Many students do not have access to personal vehicles, making it difficult to travel to essential destinations like grocery stores, internships, or off-campus jobs.

Traditional ride-sharing services (e.g., Uber, Lyft) are often too expensive and not tailored to student needs. Lynx Lifts provides a **student-centered** alternative by connecting student drivers with student passengers, offering a **safe, affordable, and convenient** transportation option exclusively within the Rhodes community.

The app enables:
- Passengers to request rides for specific times and destinations
- Drivers to view and accept those requests
- Secure peer-to-peer payments

This **community-based model** not only helps students get where they need to go, but also allows drivers to earn money on flexible schedules. Collaboration with the on-campus Lynx Lifts organization provided valuable feedback that guided the app's development, emphasizing features like safety, simplicity, and user trust.

Key design goals:
- Prioritize **ride safety** with a report system
- **Restrict access** to Rhodes students only (via email check)
- Enable **transparent and real-time communication** between users
- Deliver a clean, **user-friendly interface**
