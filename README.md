# Lynx Lifts

### 1. Project Description

Lynx Lifts is a mobile application developed to address transportation challenges faced by students at Rhodes College. Many students on campus do not have access to personal vehicles, which makes it difficult to travel to grocery stores, internships, off-campus jobs, or other essential locations. Traditional ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft can be costly and are not always accessible or tailored to student schedules. Lynx Lifts offers a student-centered solution by connecting student drivers with student passengers, creating a safe, convenient, and cost-effective transportation option within the Rhodes community.

The app allows students who need rides to submit requests for specific times and destinations. Student drivers can then view and accept these requests, providing rides in exchange for a small payment. This peer-to-peer model not only helps passengers get where they need to go, but also allows drivers to earn money on their own schedules. By keeping the service within the Rhodes College network, there is a sense of community among students.

During development, we worked closely with the Lynx Lifts organization on campus. They gave us valuable input on what they invisioned for the app, providing feedback on features such as ride safety (report system), and ease of use. Their insights helped us focus on more basic needs for the student population that we may have overlooked. 

Based on this collaboration, we prioritized safety features such as report system, limited access to rides within the Rhodes community (checking email condition), and transparent communication between drivers and passengers. With that, the user interface was designed to be clean and intuitive, allowing students to quickly find rides or offer them with minimal difficulty.

Key design goals:
- Prioritize **ride safety** with a report system
- **Restrict access** to Rhodes students only (via email check)
- Enable **transparent and real-time communication** between users
- Deliver a clean, **user-friendly interface**
